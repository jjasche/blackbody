    "You can now appreciate how HAL helped me derive the universal law called Wien's displacement law. It applies to all warm bodies, including my beloved stars. With it, I could simply measure the spectrum of a star, see at which wavelength the emission was maximal and that's it! Thanks to that wonderful plot I made, it was a piece-of-cake to determine the temperature of a star. So glad that on Tatooine the first toy newborns are given as a gift is a detector. Don't you know? No, don't laugh at me! I am serious! Well, it is a long story to tell now, and I have so many other interesting things to tell you... long story short, you must have a detector if you live in a stellar system with two stars! What would happen to you if you get lost in the system and don't know where you are? You seriously risk to end up being a fried chip for Klingon, my dear!\n",

Don't know about you, but I decided to randomly pick a few stars that looked quite different from each other and measure they spectra to get to know their temperatures. At least, after this first screening, I could understand what type of stars I had to search for.\n",

Its name comes from ancient Greek meaning “glowing” or “scorcher.” Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky. This is not surprising since, with a distance of only nine lightyears from Earth, Sirius is one the closest stars to us in the Universe. While the naked eye perceives Sirius as a single star, investigation with telescopes reveal that Sirius is a binary star system consisting of a bright white star, named Sirius A, accompanied by a faint white dwarf, called Sirius B (α CMa B). Sirius A (α CMa A) is about two times more massive and 25 times more luminous than our Sun.\n",

    "There are billions of stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way. In particular, our Sun is a medium-sized star. Each of the stars in the galaxy can be considered as an enormous ball of very hot gaseous plasma. Stars are born in so-called star-forming regions consisting of large clouds of hydrogen and a bit of helium gas. These clouds collapse due to their own gravity leading to heating of the gas. Once the gas reaches sufficiently high temperatures nuclear fusion processes are ignited. These nuclear processes produce enormous amounts of heat and radiation. A new star is born. Stars can exist for billions of years until they run out of fuel. During their final stages, stars become giants by expanding to enormous sizes, while their cores contract. Eventually, these stars explode and turn into dim, cold objects like black dwarfs, neutron stars or black holes, depending on their initial mass. Generally, the most massive stars have the shortest lifespan. More massive stars burn hotter and faster than their lighter counterparts like our sun. \n",
