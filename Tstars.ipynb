This is not surprising since, with a distance of only nine lightyears from Earth, Sirius is one the closest stars to us in the Universe. While the naked eye perceives Sirius as a single star, investigation with telescopes reveal that Sirius is a binary star system consisting of a bright white star, named Sirius A, accompanied by a faint white dwarf, called Sirius B (α CMa B).

    "There are billions of stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way. In particular, our Sun is a medium-sized star. Each of the stars in the galaxy can be considered as an enormous ball of very hot gaseous plasma. Stars are born in so-called star-forming regions consisting of large clouds of hydrogen and a bit of helium gas. These clouds collapse due to their own gravity leading to heating of the gas. Once the gas reaches sufficiently high temperatures nuclear fusion processes are ignited. These nuclear processes produce enormous amounts of heat and radiation. A new star is born. Stars can exist for billions of years until they run out of fuel. During their final stages, stars become giants by expanding to enormous sizes, while their cores contract. Eventually, these stars explode and turn into dim, cold objects like black dwarfs, neutron stars or black holes, depending on their initial mass. Generally, the most massive stars have the shortest lifespan. More massive stars burn hotter and faster than their lighter counterparts like our sun. \n",
