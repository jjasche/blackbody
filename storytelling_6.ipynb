    "Our detective has just learned that the H-R diagram is the fundamental tool for astrophysicists to learn about the evolution of stars. Stars of different sizes and luminosities usually are at different stages of their existence. The Sun, our star, is a young-adult star. Our detective is now left with the last step of his/her research. Why the habitable zone around a star is so narrow...\n",
