    "It all began 123 years ago when my best friend moved to a distant galaxy far away. I missed him so much that one night I decided to find and visit him.\n",
    "\n",
    "I packed my stuff, I sneaked out of the home and I went to the astrotrain station.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was a long ride on the train and I fell asleep. It was only when we crashed into that little asteroid that I woke up. We were already a couple thousand <b><i>AU (Astronomical Units)</i></b> from home.\n",
    "\n",
    "The train was stuck and would not go anywhere for a while. I was lost in the middle of nowhere. I didn't know exactly where my friend was living. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only thing I remembered was that my friend's family moved to this milky-something galaxy and that their stellar system had only one star called the \"Sun\". My mobile communicator was almost out of battery but a quick search on the uniweb revealed that the star, \"Sun\", was a <b><i>main sequence star</i></b>. Then my communicator went off.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had to find this \"Sun\" star in the milky-something galxy. \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>\n",
    "But how should I find a single star amongst the billions of stars in a galaxy?\n",
    "\n",
    "I could certainly need some help. But first I had to rent a private astrojet in the nearby 55 Cancri A planetary system.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I entered my astrojet, the navigation system welcomed me with a familiar funny little voice.\n",
    "\n",
    "'Hi, there! This is HAL! I will be your companion during your journey.'.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAL was the latest prototype of an autonomous navigator system. It had an incredibly large database! Almost all the books in the Universe were accessible! \n",
    "\n",
    "But my HAL system must have been broken because HAL did not answer all my questions. But at least I could discuss with HAL and sometimes HAL could provide me with useful information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together we continued on my journey to find my friend.\n",
