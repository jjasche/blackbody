    "I was more and more astonished. These simple laws of black-body radiation allow us to learn so many different things about the stars. Not only can we measure their sizes and temperatures but now the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram also tells us about their evolution. \n",

    "HAL helped me to find the only main sequence star amongst the three identified stars. This must be it. This star must be the 'Sun'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suddenly, a warning light comes on. HAL immediately informed me that the astrojet is running low on fuel. HAL said: 'I am sorry Lani, but we only have enough fuel for one landing attempt.' \n",
    "\n",
    "But where should we land? As we came closer to the stellar system of the 'Sun', the sensor system of the astrojet detects several planets orbiting the 'Sun'.\n",
    "\n",
    "I started to get nervous. We were running out of fuel and I had no idea which planet to choose for landing.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAL reminded me that not all of those planets could host life. Humans require very special conditions on the surface of a planet. In particular humans need liquid water.\n",
    "\n",
    "This singles out a specific region around a star. If a planet is to close to a star then the water will evaporate because it is too hot. On the other hand if the planet is too far away from a star then it will be so cold that all water freezes. The reason is that the planet temperature is supported by the energy received by the star. A planet that is close to the star receives a large intensity of star light, wheras a distant planet receives less starlight. This effect is similar to what happens when we are sitting around a fire. If you are too close, you may get burnt. If you are too far, you will never warm up. \n",

    "This very simple law says that the temperature of a planet is proportional to the inverse of the square root of the distance to the star. It is more complicated to say it in words than to read it from an equation. \n",

    "The Habitable Zone (HZ) around a star is the region in which a planet can possess liquid water on its surface and possibly support life. According to our current knowledge, liquid water is essential to all life on Earth, thus the definition of a HZ is based on the assumption that extraterrestrial life would share this requirement.\n",

    "<h2> Planets at thermal equilibrium </h2>\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>\n",
    "At thermal equilibrium, a planet will emit just as much radiation as it absorbs from the stellar light. For the sake of argument, we will assume that a planet is a perfect absorber and emits radiation according to the laws of black-body radiation.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>\n",
    "In particular, we assume that the planet's surface facing towards the star will absorb all radiation emitted from the star and intercepted by the planet. As the light emitted from a star is travelling further and further away from the stellar surface the intensity of emitted photons will decrease, as the same amount of light is distributed over a larger and larger surface area around the star. As a result, the luminosity of stars decreases with the square of the distance from the star, resulting in the famous inverse square law of radiation physics.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>\n",
    "As a consequence, the fraction of starlight intercepted by the planet can be estimated as the ratio between the area of the cross section of a planet of radius $d_p$ and the surface area of a sphere with a radius of the size of the planet's orbit $R_p$:\n",

    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "The laws of thermodynamic and conservation of energy dictate that in a state of thermal equilibrium the amount of radiation absorbed by the planet needs to equal its emitted radiation, that is:\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "L_{\\mathrm{emission}} &=& L_{\\mathrm{absorption}}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>\n",
    "The emission properties of actual planets typically depend on many different factors, such as their rotation, the existence of an atmosphere and the reflectance of the surface. For the sake of argument here we will ignore possible atmospheres and corresponding radiative processes at the planet.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>\n",
    "We will assume that the planet emits the absorbed radiation over its entire surface area. This is, for example, the case, if a planet rotates around an axis perpendicular to the line connecting the centre of the star and the centre of the planet.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "According to Stefan-Boltzmann law, the thermal emission from the planet's surface can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "L_{\\mathrm{emission}} &=& 4 \\, \\pi \\, d_p^2 \\, \\sigma_{\\mathrm{SB}} T_p^4 \\, ,\n",

    "\n",
    "where $T_p$ is the surface temperature of the planet.\n",

    "\n",
    "By explicitly using the expression for the stellar luminosity $ L_{\\star} = 4 \\, \\pi \\, R_{\\star}^2 \\, \\sigma_{\\mathrm{SB}} T_{\\star}^4$ we obtain a simple relation between the Temperature and size of a star and the temperature of a planet:\n",

    "This equation tells us that the surface temperature of a planet decreases with the inverse square root of the distance to the centre to the stellar system $R_p$. Planets orbiting close to the surface of the star will be hotter, while planets at larger distances will be colder. It is also important to note, that the planet's temperature depends on the properties of the host star, e.g. $R_{\\star}$ and $T_{\\star}$. The habitable zones around stars of different stellar types will therefore also vary considerably. Also note, that stars will change their temperatures and sizes during their lifetimes and thus the HZ around individual stars may also change with time. \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>\n",
    "The HZ is now defined as the range of orbit sizes $R_p$ for which a planet surface can provide liquid water. This is true for surface temperatures $T_p$ between  273 K, the melting point of water, and 373 K, the boiling point of water.\n",

    "Since the concept of the HZ was first presented in 1953 many stars have been confirmed to possess planets in the right distance from the start to support liquid water. Most notably to date, NASA's Kepler space observatory has detected hundreds of extrasolar planets orbiting their host stars just at the right distance. Some of these planets are indicated in the following plot, which illustrates the relation between the temperature of the host star and the surface temperature of detected habitable planets.\n",
