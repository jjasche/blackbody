    "One of the most fascinating questions of modern science concerns the emergence of life and where to find it in the galaxy. According to our current understanding, the most important requirement to sustain life is liquid water. This is the reason why scientists are interested in searching for environments in the Universe that can provide liquid water. In particular, at planets, the presence of liquid water depends on many environmental conditions like the temperature and pressure of the atmosphere. The main driver of the surface temperature of a planet, however, is the central star, around which the planet orbits at some distance.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>\n",
    "At least on Earth liquid water is essential to the existence of life. For this reason regions around stars that permit surface temperatures between 273 K, the melting point of water, and 373 K, the boiling point of water, are called habitable zones. The proposed definition of a habitable zone thus is clearly based on the hypothesis that extraterrestrial life shares this requirement.</p>\n",

    "The simple laws of blackbody radiation permit us to derive remarkably simple relations between the Temperature of a star $T_{\\star}$, its size $R_{\\star}$ and the temperature of a planet $T_p$ orbiting at a distance $R_p$ from the center of the stellar system:\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "T_p &=& T_{\\star}\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{R_{\\star}}{2 \\, R_p}} \\, .\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",

    "This simple equation provides a good start for investigating the question of where to find life in the Universe. \n",
    "\n",
    "Realistic models of planetary temperatures need to account for more details. In particular, Earth climate is determined by an atmosphere and also the albedo of a planet plays a crucial role. The albedo of a planet determines how much starlight will be reflected and how much of it will be thermalized at the planet's surface and converted to heat. A crucial part of the Earth's albedo is the enormous white icefields at the poles which reflect sunlight into space and prevent that Earth will heat too much. On the other hand molecules in the atmosphere will prevent that the Earth emits too much thermal radiation and cools too quickly. The latter effect is also called the greenhouse effect and is related to the discussion on the topic of global climate change. All these effects determine the balance between absorbed and emitted energy and are crucially determining the habitability of planets.\n",
