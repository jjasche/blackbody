    "The world as we know it is no more. The vibrant energies from the cities are all gone, only containing abandoned buildings - not a single soul in sight. Cars fill the freeway with nature slowly enveloping all of which was once humanity’s glory. The dead have become restless walk the face of the Earth - the zombie apocalypse is upon us!\n",
    "\n",
    "It all started a couple of years ago. The airports were the first to be infected by the viral plague, hastily spreading to all of the major cities around the globe. Thereafter slowly spreading into all corners of the Earth. Sweden held on for as long as it could, but could not keep the zombies at bay forever.\n",

    "You and your friends have found shelter at the Esrange Space Center in Kiruna, a safe place with plenty of water and food - you are sure that it will take some time before the zombies find you here. You sense the safety of the Space Center but wonder, how long? How long before they find you? How long before you join their ranks?\n",

    "When exploring the facility, you stumble upon what you realize to be a space shuttle! This means that you can leave the Earth and start a new civilization on a new planet!\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects with temperatures larger than absolute zero ( 0 K or -273.15 °C) emit energy in terms of electromagnetic radiation. This is the phenomenon of blackbody radiation. Black bodies are idealized objects that perfectly absorb incident radiation of any frequency and angle of incidence. They do not reflect any light, nor do they allow any light to pass through it. That is why black bodies appear black at room temperature. In contrast, a white body would reflect all incident radiation uniformly in all directions (add some references).\n",
    "\n",
    "In thermal equilibrium, that is at a constant temperature, black bodies emit electromagnetic radiation. The emission spectrum of this black body radiation follows Planck's law and is solely determined by the object's temperature. Shape or composition of a black body has no impact on its emission spectrum. With increasing temperature blackbodies emit more light at all wavelengths. This means, when comparing two blackbodies, the hotter one will always emit more light than the cooler one, regardless of the wavelength.\n",
    "\n",
    "The emission spectrum of a blackbody is continuous and peaks at a specific wavelength, at which the intensity of the spectrum is maximal. This peak wavelength of the blackbody radiation shifts to shorter wavelengths for hotter objects. \n",
    "In terms of visible light, the hotter a blackbody is the bluer the peak wavelength of its emission will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "A detailed explanation of the blackbody radiation requires knowledge on quantum mechanics as pioneered by Max Planck in 1900. A full quantum mechanical description of the black body phenomenon is beyond the scope of this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, there exists no ideal blackbody, but many objects like light bulbs, candles, hot metal or lava behave approximately like black bodies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The black body radiation has particular relevance for cosmology and astrophysics. One of the best measurements of a naturally occurring black body emission spectrum was obtained by ESA's Planck satellite mission, which observed the cosmic microwave background radiation, a relic radiation of the hot big bang from the beginning of our Universe.\n",
    "Also, the emission spectrum of stars, which are hot luminous spheroids of gaseous plasma, can be approximated by a Planck law.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the course of this workshop, we want to use the phenomenon of blackbody radiation to make sense of astrophysical observations. \n",
